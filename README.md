# Beta

Welcome to my beta repository! This is a collection of my personal projects and code experiments in various programming languages, all in the beta phase of development.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a workspace for starter ideas, practice projects, and experimental code across multiple programming languages and domains.

## Structure

The repository is organized by programming language and technology:

### 🔧 Embedded C (`embedded-c/`)
Embedded systems programming and low-level C code
- **examples/** - Code examples and starter templates
- **projects/** - Full project implementations
- **utilities/** - Utility functions and helper code
- **libraries/** - Reusable libraries

### ⚡ C++ (`cpp/`)
C++ practice and projects
- **examples/** - Code examples and starter templates
- **projects/** - Full project implementations
- **utilities/** - Utility functions and helper code
- **libraries/** - Reusable libraries and components

### 🎯 C# (`csharp/`)
C# applications and experiments
- **examples/** - Code examples and starter templates
- **projects/** - Full project implementations
- **utilities/** - Utility functions and helper code
- **libraries/** - Reusable class libraries

### 🐍 Python (`python/`)
Python scripts, applications, and modules
- **examples/** - Code examples and starter templates
- **projects/** - Full project implementations
- **utilities/** - Utility scripts and helper code
- **libraries/** - Reusable modules and packages

## Getting Started

Navigate to any of the language-specific directories to explore the code. Each directory contains its own README with more details about the projects and code within.

## Note

All projects in this repository are in beta phase - they are works in progress and may be incomplete, experimental, or subject to change.
